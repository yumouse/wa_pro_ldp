* First: **create** your own branch with name as (wk,gst,psy,jyb,xhc)
    * Then work on your own branch
    * Create your own file directory (for merge maybe)
* The file tree will be like:
repo
 |
 +----src
 |     |
 |     +--gen.py
 |     +--example.py
 |     +--ReadME.md
 |
 +----wk
 |     |
 |     +---files
 |
 +----xxx
 |     |
 |     +---

* Second: please read the doc in ./src 
    * Know the generation of data
    * Know how to use the gen.py
* Happy to work with all of you! Let's move!
